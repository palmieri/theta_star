Theta* Path Finding Algorithm implementation in C++

Based on standard libraries.

For description of the algorithm refer to the paper "Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids" written by Alex Nash, Kenny Daniel, Sven Koenig and Ariel Felner.


## TODOs
* Include a User class example that shows how to use it.
